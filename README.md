# E08b-Adding-Tiles

I continued working from the last assignment, E08a-Paddle Ball. On Cavas, there was a repository for the second part of the assignment. I forked and cloned the given repository on Canvas. I opened the file on Godot. For this assignment, I added another node representing node and child nodes representing the tiles in different colors, such as gray and red. I also added some tiles with different colors in 5 rows. While I was working on adding the tiles, I added a given code on Canvas. I also added another given code on Canvas to the ball. When I added codes for both tiles and balls, I ran the game to see if it works properly. Luckily, it worked well. Everytime when the player bounces the ball off the paddle by using a mouse, the ball will crack the tiles. The tiles will disappear when they get hit. After running the game, I commited to GitHub by using GitHub Desktop. Then, I edited LICENSE and README.md.
